            <h2>About the Project</h2>

            <p>Marie Stopes Madagascar (MSM) has partnered with more than 100
                private doctors and clinics throughout
                Madagascar, collectively known as the BlueStar Network, to
                provide family planning and reproductive
                healthcare for low-income women and couples. </p>

            <h2>The Challenge</h2>

            <p>In the past, MSM collected data from each of the 100+ doctors
                using a paper-based system. However, MSM
                found this method error-prone, expensive and unreliable.
                <br/>Data arrived at headquarters sporadically, making trend
                analysis impossible. Overall, MSM received
                less than half of all required reports.
                To expand the network and collect data from even more
                remote rural areas, MSM needed a new tool.
            </p>

            <h2>Action Taken</h2>

            <p>MSM hired HNI to build its own internal capacity to collect data
                electronically.
                <br/>Together with HNI, MSM staff chose a list of important
                monthly indicators (e.g. client
                contraceptive choice by method). HNI built and installed the
                new application. Right away, MSM began
                collecting valuable data from the doctors. </p>

            <h2>The Result</h2>

            <p>Now, more than 95% of all doctors send in their monthly reports
                via SMS by the specified deadline,
                compared with less than half prior to HNI’s intervention. </p>

            <p>“We needed timely, accurate and complete data on a monthly basis
                from our doctors.
                <br/>Once we had a solid baseline over several months for each
                doctor, we started analyzing which of our
                marketing efforts directly led to spikes in clients seen.
                <br/>Thanks to HNI, we now have a much better idea where to
                spend our limited resources.” - Miles
                Kemplay, Country Director of MSM.</p>

            <p>MSM management noted 2 additional advantages to SMS-based data
                collection. </p>
            <ol>
                <li>Doctors report motivational benefits from the confirmation
                    messages they receive in response to
                    submitted data.
                </li>
                <li>Regular reporting via mobile phones has helped network
                    members grow accustomed to using technology
                    as a part of their professional lives.
