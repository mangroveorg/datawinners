msgstr "Choose the Summary Report option if you want your Data Senders(in other words,people in the field) to answer a basic list of questions."

"<br/>2) A supervisor measures the quality of care at a clinic. The subject is the clinic"
"<br/>3) An engineer measures the flow rate of a water pump.  The subject is the water pump."
"<br/>In each case, the Data Senders (in other words, people in the field) must first identify the specific “subject” (baby/clinic/water pump)."
"<br/>For example, the Data Sender would first answer the question: “What baby are you reporting on?”"
"<br/>All subsequent questions would be about the baby.  (Example:  “How much did the baby weigh?”)"

"To collect individual reports about specific subjects, you have two choices."
"<br/><br/>"
"1. Each time, you can ask your Data Senders to send in background information about the subject (Example:"
" What is the baby's name? Where does the baby live?)"
"<br/><br/>Or<br/><br/>"
"2. Register the background information about the subject first, then going forward have your Data Senders identify "
"each subject using a unique identification number (example: \"What is the unique identification number of the baby?\""
"Answer: bab001)<br/><br/>"
"There are three important advantages to using unique identification numbers:"
"<ol style='margin-left: 20px;'><li>Improve the quality of your data. Data Senders frequently make spelling mistakes "
"(Example: A Data Sender spells a baby's name \"Avery\" during the first visit, then \"Avary\" during segond. "
"When spelling mistakes happen, you have to \"clean\" your data by determining if \"Avery\" and \"Avary\" are two"
"different babies, or the same baby. Mistakes happen less frequently with unique identification numbers"
"</li><li> Make data collection easier by reducing the number of questions. It's easier for your Data Senders to "
"answer one question (what is the baby's identification number?) rather than, say, four background questions "
"(1. What is the baby'sname? 2. Where does the baby live? 3. How old is the baby? 4. What is the mother's name?)"
"</li><li>Once subjects are registered in DataWinners, you can collect a variety of data about them. You may want to "
"collect several different individual reports for one subject (example: a report when the baby is seen at a nutritional "
"center and a second report when the community agent visits the baby at home).<br/>"
"After registering the baby with DataWinners, your DataSenders can use the baby's unique identification number for "
"multiple questionnaires.</li></ol>"
"<br/>If you want to register your subjects with DataWinners, the first step is to identify the subject type (Example: "
"Patient, Clinic, Water Pump).<br/><br/>"
"Once you choose a subject type (Example: Baby), you will see this question appear in your questionnaire builder: "
"\"Which baby are you reporting on?\".<br/><br/>"
"In a later step, you will:"
"<ol style='margin-left: 20px;'><li>Create your baby registration form</li><li>Register a list of your babies with DataWinners so each is assigned"
" a unique identification number.</li></ol>"
